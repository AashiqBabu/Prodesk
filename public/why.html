          Why stand and work
        </h1>

        <p>
          Too much of anything kills. The same is true of fried food, alcohol, and now – researchers are finding out – sitting. A study
          reveals that men who sit six hours or more a day have an overall death rate that’s 20 percent higher than men who
          sit for three hours or less. For women, it’s 40 percent. And consider this: nothing you do can cancel out the effects
          of sitting for long hours in the office. Sitting harms you even if you benefit from a gym workout. Whenever possible,
          office workers are advised to get up and take movement breaks throughout the day. It’s not always easy to just
          walk away from the task at hand, though, so in some cases workers are combining the best of both worlds by installing
          standing desks. Benefits of Standing Desks.</p>

        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          1. May Boost Productivity
        </h2>
        <p>
          Standing desks increase productivity by almost 50 percent in the workplace. Standing helps get things done as it forces you
          to focus more deeply and plough through work. It reduces fatigue and maintains mental sharpness, something that
          is not typical of sitting for hours at a workstation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Research published in IIE Transactions on Occupational Ergonomics and Human Factors suggest that, yes, working at a standing
          desk benefits productivity. The study compared objective productivity measures between workers who use a stand-capable
          desk and a seated control group in a call center over six months for 167 employees. The findings revealed that
          workers with desks that allow for standing were about 45 percent more productive on a daily basis than those who
          remained seated. Further, productivity of the stand-capable desk users significantly increased over time, from
          about 23 percent in the 1st month to 53 percent over the next 6 months.
        </p>

        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          2. Standing Desks Help Improve Mood and Energy Levels
        </h2>
        <p>Standing desks appear to have a positive influence on overall well-being. In one 7-week study, participants using
          standing desks reported less stress and fatigue than those who remained seated the entire work day . Additionally,
          87% of those using standing desks reported increased vigor and energy throughout the day.Upon returning to their
          old desks, overall moods reverted to their original levels. These findings align with broader research on sitting
          and mental health, which links sedentary time with an increased risk of both depression and anxiety.</p>
        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          3. Less Obesity Risk
        </h2>
        <p>Here’s how sitting affects your health: when you slump in your chair, your calorie-burning slows to a third of the
          rate compared to walking. Metabolism drops. As a result, your risk of becoming obese and developing diabetes grows.
          Here, by using a standing desk at work, you burn more calories and counteract the effects of sitting for long periods
          of time. In fact, when compared to an afternoon of sedentary work, an equal amount of time spent standing has been
          shown to burn over 170 additional calories. That’s almost 1000 extra calories burned each week from simply standing
          at your desk each afternoon.
        </p>

        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          4. Using a Standing Desk May Lower Blood Sugar Levels
        </h2>
        <p>Generally speaking, the more your blood sugar levels increase after meals, the worse it is for your health. In a
          small study of 10 office workers, standing for 180 minutes after lunch reduced the blood sugar spike by 43% compared
          to sitting for the same amount of time. Both groups took the same amount of steps, indicating that the smaller
          spike was due to standing rather than additional physical movements around the office.
        </p>

        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          5. Reduced Cancer Risk
        </h2>
        <p>Breast cancer and colon cancer are the ones that appear most related to lack of physical activity. A study from 2011
          reported that 43,000 cases of colon cancer and 49,000 cases of breast cancer annually are caused by prolonged sitting.
          Though the cases weren’t as conclusive, the same study reported that ovarian, prostate, lung, and endometrial cancer
          also showed a strong connection to prolonged sitting. There is not a definitive answer as to why sitting appears
          to cause these types of cancer, but it’s possible that increases in C-reactive protein, found in people who sit
          for long periods of time, is the culprit.</p>

        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          6. Standing Desks Appear to Reduce Back Pain
        </h2>
        <p>Back pain is one of the most common complaints of office workers who sit all day. To determine if standing desks
          could improve this, several studies have been done on employees with long-term back pain. Participants have reported
          up to a 32% improvement in lower back pain after several weeks of using standing desks. Another study published
          by the CDC found that use of a sit-stand desk reduced upper back and neck pain by 54% after just 4 weeks. Additionally,
          removal of the sit-stand desks reversed some of those improvements within a 2-week period.</p>


        <h2 class="m-t-50">
          7. Standing More May Help You Live Longer
        </h2>
        <p>Studies have found a strong link between increased sitting time and early death. In fact, a review of 18 studies
          found those who sit the most are at a 49% greater risk of dying early than those who sit the least. Another study
          estimated that reducing sitting time to 3 hours per day would raise the average person’s life expectancy by 2 years.
          While these observational studies do not prove cause and effect, the weight of evidence indicates standing more
          often could help lengthen our lifespan.

          Once you have taken the First step
        </h1>
        <p>
          Start slow - Don’t try to go from usual hours of sitting to zero overnight. Aim to sit just three of your working hours each
          day. So start with just 20 minutes at a time at your standing desk, then add on time as you get used to the setup.
          For example, you could start the day by standing, and tie in certain tasks with it. As the day wears on, you could
          sit and pair that with other routines. Standing doesn’t sound like a lot of work, but when your body is used to
          sitting most of the day, you will strain your body by standing too much, too fast. Use a mat - Take it easy on
          your knees, hips, and ankles by using a gel mat where you plan to stand. Take it a step further and wear non-slip,
          supportive shoes, too. Get your work done - If standing is too distracting, use your sitting times when you need
          that extra concentration. You may find the standing desk a little distracting at first, but you’ll likely adjust
          and learn to refocus with time. Set it up right - Your computer screen should sit 15 to 30 inches from your eyes,
          with your eye level even with (or slightly below) your screen. Keep your wrists flat and your elbows at a 90-degree
          angle. If you feel like any part of your body is straining while you are standing then you need to make adjustments
          to make it more comfortable. Move, too - Standing does burn more calories than sitting, but to really see optimal
          health benefits make sure you are walking throughout the workday, too. The American Heart Association suggests
          10,000 steps per day at a minimum. Buy a pedometer or a fitness tracker and add in steps where you see fit during
          the day. Look for creative ways to do other exercises during the workday, too, that stretch your muscles and keep
          your circulation and metabolism going.
